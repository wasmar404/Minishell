/**
 * check_and_create_pipe - Checks if there is a pipe after a command until another command is reached.
 * If found, the pipe is created.
 * 
 * @head: A double pointer to the next node after the command.
 * @pipe_fd: An array of two integers representing the file descriptors for the pipe.
 * @flag: A pointer to a flag that is incremented when a pipe is created.
 * 
 * Description:
 * This function iterates through the linked list of tokens, starting from the node after the command. 
 * If it encounters a `PIPE` token before a `COMMAND` token, it creates a pipe.  
 * If pipe creation fails, the function prints an error message and exits.  
 * If no pipe is found, `pipe_fd` is set to `-1, -1`.
